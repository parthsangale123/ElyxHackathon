try to have 5-10 msgs/week

assume that the memeber also does some research or reads about healht and gets curious questions about certain topics so there shd be upto 5 converstations started by the member per week on avg make sure each conversation is human like and doesn't not end with 1 q and 1 answer reply

are you aware about the test panel results to be discussed every 3 months?

is that included in our converstations?

can we like show these test results visually/somehow in task 2

let's start with task 2

well implement it in a website format then let's see what we got

well ain't exactly task 2 is it i will upload the json file and then generate the stuff eh? so that's better also journey timeline is a bit bad not 32 week so....

i want an option to upload the JSON file in WEBPAGE ITSELF so make the website on that lines

can u explain the code

in that JSON file make changes to include internal metrics and health metrics

why do we need these can't we have some in JSON file itself

go through this (followed by file upload)
